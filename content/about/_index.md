As a Web Developer, I have been building interactive experiences, creating brands and developing websites since 2012. I’m a fan of structure and simplicity in both design and code; organization and consistency are very important to me.

I am an alumnus of AACC, graduating with a degree in Computer Science and two certificates. Last year I obtained a certification from Acquia, signifying I'm now a Drupal Certified Developer. I'm always looking to grow professionally and personally.
