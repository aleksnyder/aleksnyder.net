Hi! I’m Alek. I’m a Software Developer living in the little-known town of Gambrills in Maryland. Currently, I'm taking a short break before starting up the job search again. My previous job was at [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co).  Welcome to my little piece of the internet. 🌱

As a Software Developer, I have been building interactive experiences, creating brands and developing websites since 2012. I’m a fan of structure and simplicity in both design and code; organization and consistency are very important to me.

This site has no ads, no affiliate links and no analytics. I use it as a playground to try out ideas and share what I’ve learned. To see more, check out my open-source work on [GitHub](https://github.com/aleksnyder).
