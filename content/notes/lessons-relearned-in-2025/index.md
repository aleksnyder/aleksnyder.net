Now that we're in 2026, I had some time to reflect on 2025, the challenges I encountered, and how I responded to them.
Some of these lessons I've already learned, but I ended up repeating the same mistakes from earlier in my career.
Maybe writing them down will help me avoid them in the future.  Who knows, maybe they'll help someone else too.

{{< h2 >}}Being too attached to a project{{< /h2 >}}

It's easy to become attached to a project, especially when you're working on it full-time.  You think about how to
improve the code, how to make it more efficient, and how to make it more maintainable; but you forget that you're also
working on other projects, and that you're not always going to have the time to do all of that.  Decisions made about
the project, which are out of your control, feel more personal than they should be.

While it's good to be passionate about your work, too much emphasis on a particular project can do a number to your
mental health.  Especially when the inevitable "leadership/client changed their mind" email comes in while working on a project; or
another project or issue needs your attention.  If you work on multiple projects or initiatives, I would suggest taking
a step back, zoom out, and move your focus to a level where it encompasses all your tasks.

If you're like me and sometimes put too much emphasis on the number of accomplishments you've made, being asked to set aside an unfinished project can
hit harder.  A solution I've found is to break up what's been done on a project into smaller tasks, so I can see how much
has already been achieved even if the project is unfinished. Then I add these accomplishments to my [bragdoc](/notes/keep-a-bragdoc)
to remind myself of what I've completed. Ideally, I wouldn't put so much of myself into a project, but one step at a time.

{{< h2 >}}Brag about yourself a little bit{{< /h2 >}}

Now I'm not saying to insert your accomplishments into daily conversations, but Leads and Managers a few levels above you
should know that you're doing great work. Your immediate team and your supervisor probably know the work you do, but the
higher up you go, the more likely that person did not pay attention to your day-to-day work. 

If your team or org has a daily email, see if something you've done can be added to it.  Ask about any major initiatives
the director or lead or executive cares about and see if you can work on it.  You don't have to work on every initiative,
but one every now and again can help you get noticed.  Staying in the background working on your tasks is fine and can
keep you out of the spotlight; but you run the risk of being let go when someone higher up looks at your team's roster and believes
your role is redundant.  Again, keep track of your accomplishments in your [bragdoc](/notes/keep-a-bragdoc).
It can be easy to forget what you've done when you're busy with something else.

When the time comes for promotions or restructuring, a little bragging could help you get promoted or avoid a layoff.

{{< h2 >}}Some decisions are just random{{< /h2 >}}

Ever work on a project for a long time and start to feel a little bit of excitement knowing you're close to the finish line;
but then you're notified by leadership or the client to suddenly stop?  It sucks.  Especially when the project is completely
shelved.  It feels like all the effort, work, and time you put into it were wasted.  In some ways it was, but you can recycle
ideas, and maybe even some of the code.

You may start to think did something I, or the team, did contribute to this decision?  Did we take too long?  Did we not communicate
our progress well enough?  Did anything we do in another meeting or project influence this decision?  In my experience,
these decisions are often made by people who don't have a lot of context about the project or for money reasons.  Another
reason could be the stakeholder(s) are influenced by "vibes" and have moved on to another shinier initiative.

Regardless of the reason, my suggestion would be to ask yourself what can be recycled from the canceled project.  Maybe you
can use a component in a component library, maybe a deployment workflow could be used in your next project, or maybe you
can document the steps for setting up the project in an onboarding script.  Working on a nearly finished project that's canceled
is frustrating, but some useful lessons can be learned from it.  Plus, if your projects are run by "vibes," then this canceled
project won't be the last one.  You should find some silver linings somewhere.  In my opinion, losing code or work I've done is
nowhere near as bad as losing time.

{{< h2 >}}Working overtime is rarely worth it{{< /h2 >}}

I learn and relearn this lesson more often than I should.  Every time I've worked extra hours in my career trying to push a project
over the finish line, it did not pay off.  Sure, some tasks met some arbitrary deadline someone else set for me, but it was not remembered
by the ones pushing for the task or project to be completed.  You know who does remember?  Your family, friends, and those close to you.
That's time you can spend with your family or friends.  That's time you could use to unwind after a stressful day.  That's time
you could spend on a hobby or a new project.  It's not worth it.  I've burned out twice in my career.  Once should be
enough, but I went and did it a second time.  I may not have even recovered from the first one when I felt it the second time around.

If you're constantly feeling overworked, take some time off.  It doesn't have to be consecutive days, but a few days over the course of a
few weeks can really help.  If your job has on-call rotations, try to subtract the hours on-call from your normal working hours.
Reach out to your lead or supervisor and tell them how you're feeling.  Maybe try to remove some work off your plate.  In the
long term it might be worth switching to a different team, org, or even a new job.  A therapist can help too.

Take it from someone who worked long hours for a project, while managing too many tasks on the side, covering for team members
out sick or caring for loved ones, dealing with stress at home, being on-call, and then getting dragged into another project
caused by a few years of neglect.  It's not worth it.  Especially because that project was never finished and leadership didn't recognize
the time and effort I put into keeping everything on track.  Ultimately, I was laid off.  I think I learned my lesson this time.
