## Project Overview
Apprenticeship.gov is the Department of Labor's one-stop place for all things apprenticeship.  Whether it's prospective apprentices
looking for new opportunities, employers searching for how to register their apprenticeship program, the media looking for information about 
policies or downloadable resources, or educators pointing out to students the benefits of apprenticeship.

## Responsibilities
During the development of apprenticeship.gov, I was involved in many of the architecture discussions deciding how to build out a
new feature, section, or initiative.

Once a direction was chosen, I would develop the back-end, front-end, and facilitate the launch of the feature, section, or initiative
following the requirement(s) given by the team.
