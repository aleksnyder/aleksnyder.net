title: Training Provider Results
description: Senior Full-stack developer and team lead responsible for aggregating training data using Elasticsearch and Drupal. Then, building the APIs needed for the AngularJS front-end.
contribution: As a contractor for the U.S. Department of Labor, I was tasked with leading the effort to aggregate training data, serve that data, and provide an easy to use, modern way to search the national training data.  As the Senior Full-stack developer and team lead, we set up an Elasticsearch index, an ingestion pipeline from a CSV source into Drupal, and then created a location-aware API for Angular to search.
projectBrief: TrainingProviderResults.gov helps further the U.S. Department of Labor’s mission of providing high-quality job training and enhanced employment opportunities to the American workforce.  Department of Labor needed a way to search and display these opportunities for prospective applicants looking for new ways to train or retrain.
