## Project Overview
Early in 2015, I was approached by BDM Enterprises LLC. to build a website for them. Their goal was to attract new customers in Central Maryland. I was tasked by BDM to build a website which was simple, responsive, and easy to use.

## Responsibilities
I designed and built the BDM Enterprises site from scratch using plain ol' HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.
