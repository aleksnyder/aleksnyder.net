title: BDM Enterprises
description: Project page for BDM Enterprises. A static site built with plain ol' HTML, CSS, and a dash of JavaScript.
contribution: I designed and built the BDM Enterprises site from scratch using plain ol' HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.  Additionally, I gathered requirements from the client and provided input on what potential users would want from this site.
projectBrief: Early in 2015, I was approached by BDM Enterprises LLC. to build a website for them. Their goal was to attract new customers in Central Maryland. I was tasked by BDM to build a website which was simple, responsive, and easy to use.
