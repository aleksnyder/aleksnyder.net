title: Search.elastic.co
description: Senior Full-stack developer heavily involved in delivering a React‑based rebuild of Elastic's search experience, including the introduction of new Elasticsearch features and AI-assisted results.
contribution: As part of Elastic's web team, I was tasked with updating the search experience.  My initial task was to conduct research on existing content sources, determine which new Elastic features to showcase, configure a crawler, and build a modern front-end to encapsulate those improvements.
projectBrief: Elastic was founded and built on its search products.  The existing site search hasn't been updated since 2018.  Having a first-class search experience for the main site search using Elasticsearch's latest features was important for the company's future plans.
